--A SQL PRIMER--
----------------

The following sql query is very basic.  However, it has the major sections
required of most queries.  You can mimic the syntax and add and subtract fields
that may be required by you.  Some lines, I have commented out (the script will 
not execute those lines) with at least two dashes preceeding any text.

Most sql queries will have 2-4 sections:

select --- after which you list the columns you want to display in the results
from  ---  after which you list the table(s) that the selected columns reside
where ---  basically, these are filters or other criteria that must be met
order by --- by which column(s) do you want to sort and what direction to sort




select
     CUSTOMER_NUMBER        
     --,PARENT_CUSTOMER_NUMBER                    --- to comment out lines use 3 hyphens
     --,DISTRIBUTOR_NUMBER
     ,CUST_INSERT_UPDATE_FLAG
     ,PROCESSED_DATE
     ,INTERNAL_COMMENT_TEXT
from
     frcmo.eds_ar_customers_int@rcom.world        --- this is a schema.table@a_different_database
where
     CUSTOMER_NUMBER = '&your_customer_account'   --- the ampersand symbol will prompt the user for the parameter value
     --CUSTOMER_NUMBER in ('10002924','10002928','10003028')
     --and INTERNAL_COMMENT_TEXT is not null
     --and CUST_INSERT_UPDATE_FLAG = 'I'
     --and PROCESSED_DATE > '15-OCT-2002'
     --and rownum < 10
order by
     CUSTOMER_NUMBER asc                          --- asc means ascending; desc means decending

select pac.segment

where PAC.ANALYSIS_CRITERIA_ID IN 
      ( select ppa.ANALYSIS_CRITERIA_ID
