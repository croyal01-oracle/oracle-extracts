LOOKS AT THE "MISSING COST RATE" DISTRIBUTION ERRORS FOR TRANSACTIONS AFTER A CERTAIN
DATE THAT ARE NOT "Labor Recording" EXPENDITURE TYPES.  THESE ARE GIVEN TO PAYROLL TO
DETERMINE HOW TO FIX (IF APPROPRIATE).

select hap.full_name, eia.expenditure_type, eia.expenditure_item_date, eia.quantity, ea.expenditure_group
from pa.pa_expenditure_items_all eia
	, pa.pa_expenditures_all ea
	, hr.per_all_people_f hap
where eia.cost_dist_rejection_code = 'NO_RATE'
and eia.expenditure_type != 'Labor Recording'
and eia.expenditure_item_date > '24-DEC-00'
and ea.incurred_by_person_id = hap.person_id
and eia.expenditure_id = ea.expenditure_id
order by hap.full_name


THE SECOND QUERY GETS A COUNT FOR THE NUMBER OF RECORDS GETTING THIS ERROR THAT 
NEED TO BE RESET TO 0.

select count(*)
from pa.pa_expenditure_items_all
where cost_dist_rejection_code = 'NO_RATE'
and raw_cost is null


THE THIRD QUERY IS WHAT IS EMAILED TO THE DBA TO RUN -- 
LET HIM KNOW HOW MANY RECORDS WILL BE AFFECTED (FROM THE ABOVE QUERY).

update pa.pa_expenditure_items_all
set raw_cost = 0
where cost_dist_rejection_code = 'NO_RATE'
and raw_cost is null
